 bulgarians.9.t:0 "Treaty with Bulgaria"

 bulgarians.15.t:0 "The Balkan Federation"
 bulgarians.15.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered that we join a faction with them based on our shared ideologies. It might be good, as this would prove that the Balkans can actually be united."

 bulgarians.15.b:0 "I think not."
 bulgarians.16.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"

 bulgarians.20.t:0 "Greece Declined!"
 bulgarians.20.d:0 "The Greeks have declined our demands for Thrace! We should show them who has the real power here!"

 bulgarians.21.b:0 "We don't need anyone."
 bulgarians.22.t:0 "Invitation to the Entente"
 bulgarians.22.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested that we reform the Balkan Entente with them included. They made this request to Yugoslavia, and they seemingly agreed to this request, so either way they will form it. Now the question is if we want to join as well."

 bulgarians.22.b:0 "Let's not."
 bulgarians.23.t:0 "Yugoslavia said no!"
 bulgarians.23.d:0 "Yugoslavia has said no to our request to reform the Balkan Entente. Now I suppose this means they are no longer allied either, but we are not in an alliance with any of them either."
 bulgarians.23.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.24.t:0 "Macedonian Uprising!"
 bulgarians.24.d:0 "The Macedonians have risen up against us! Our way of dealing with them was less effective than hoped, and now they have risen up against us. We dealt with them, but it costed us manpower that's not easily replaced. However, we made sure it would not happen again."
 bulgarians.25.t:0 "An agreement proposed!"
 bulgarians.25.d:0 "The Bulgarians have proposed an agreement. For the Bulgarians have a clean record of adhering to the effects of the peace treaty of the Great War. They may have redeemed themselves, and they might be a usefull ally."
 bulgarians.25.a:0 "Alright, fine."
 bulgarians.25.b:0 "What, no!"
 bulgarians.26.t:0 "Greece agreed!"
 bulgarians.26.d:0 "Good news! The Greeks have agreed to lift the restrictions placed upon our country. We can now finally start preparing our country for the upcoming conflict."
 bulgarians.26.a:0 "Victory!"
 bulgarians.27.t:0 "The Greeks disagreed!"
 bulgarians.27.d:0 "The obviously disillusioned government of Greece has disagreed to our rearmament! We must act on this! If we are to prepare our country, then we shall have to stop abiding by the peace treaty."
 bulgarians.27.a:0 "Then so we shall."
