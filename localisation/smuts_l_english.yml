 smuts.1.desc:0 "Prime Minister Hertzog has always staunchly opposed the breakout of hostilities between the Union of South Africa and the German Reich, instead pursuing a more independent foreign policy seperate from the British Empire. Now that war has broken out with the Dominion of South Africa fighting loyally at the side of the motherland, the prime minister has seen fit to resign. The more pro-British faction behind Jan Smuts will now lead both South Africa and the United Party."
