coastal_defense_ship_desc:0"The Sverige class consisted of three coastal battleships built for the Swedish Navy before World War I. The ships more closely resembled heavy cruisers in both size (displacement of over 6,800 tons) and armament (four 283mm/44 K/45 M12 guns). The ships were relatively slow for a cruiser but were very well-armored. All three ships served during World War II."
