norway_mod.37.t:0 "The Norwegians have denied us compensation"
norway_mod.37.d:0 "Claiming they did what was necessary, the Norwegians have denied us compensation, saying siding with Germany was necessary for the survival of all our nations. This will not be easy to smooth over for us, but such a move and their lacking will to compromise have surely damaged the Norwegian politicians' credibility even more."
norway_mod.37.a:0 "This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals"

norway_mod.38.t:0 "Upholding our end of the bargain"
norway_mod.38.d:0 "Slesvig-Holsten is ours, and the Norwegians have upheld their end of the bargain. Measures are now being taken to hand Greenland back to them once more, as was our part of the deal."

norway_mod.81.t:0 "Iceland Reintegrated"
norway_mod.81.d:0 "Fate has once again brought us together with the Isle of Viking Sagas. Originally Norwegians fleeing the rule and taxes of our first King, and later brought back into the Norwegian Kingdom, the Danish Union and treaty of Kiel once took Iceland away from us along with the Faroes and Greenland. Our similar culture, history and ancestry now bring us together once more."
norway_mod.81.a:0 "Another event worthy of a Saga"

norway_mod.82.t:0 "Greenland Reintegrated"
norway_mod.82.d:0 "While the original Norwegian-Icelandic settlers on Greenland died out, Greenland was brought back into the Norwegian fold by a Dano-Norwegian mission which reached the island in the 1720s. The treaty of Kiel took this island away from us, with us having little say in the matter. And the Greenland case did not work out well for us either... Now, however, fate has brought it back to us. While the new settlers of this island, the Inuit people, have been Christened and integrated, they're not originally of Norwegian ancestry like the Faroese and Icelandic peoples, so integration has naturally been harder here. But now, finally, the Inuit are starting to settle into their new nation."
norway_mod.82.a:0 "The Inuit will do well in our nation"

norway_mod.83.t:0 "Båhuslen Reintegrated"
norway_mod.83.d:0 "Båhuslen was Norwegian land for 800 years before it was lost in one of the many wars between the Danes and Swedes, with us involved due to our union with Denmark. And while it was briefly recaptured, it didn't make the peace treaties. Now though, events have brought it into our ownership once more, and the people of Båhuslen are ready to contribute to their new nation, no doubt our long history and our common heritage helping."
norway_mod.83.a:0 "Our numbers grow, as do our coastline"

norway_mod.84.t:0 "Jamtland Reintegrated"
norway_mod.84.d:0 "The rough, yet beautiful landscapes of Jamtland, as well as its inhabitants, have been reintegrated into the Norwegian nation. There is however, the question on what we name this new addition to our country, or rather, how we name it. Should we use modern Norwegian written language, or something based on our other less common written language, but which is more traditional, and conforms to both the dialects of the Jamtlanders themselves and our bordering region of Trøndelag? There's also the back to our roots approach where we give it its old norse name."
norway_mod.84.a:0 "Let's go with the written language of the majority, the bokmål variant"
norway_mod.84.b:0 "Let's stick with traditions and local dialects, the nynorsk variant"
norway_mod.84.c:0 "Let's go back to our common roots, the Norse variant"

norway_mod.85.t:0 "Hjaltland and Orknøyene Reintegrated"
norway_mod.85.d:0 "The Northern Isles and Sutherland, once part of the Jarldom of Orkney, one of the highest titles to be held within the Norwegian Kingdom, have surprisingly come under our ownership again. With a mixed heritage of Norwegian, Celtic and Scots, the people of the area have been integrated once more into our nation, and they are willing to become citizens. But how shall we name the area now? In a modern way, a traditional way, or a very traditional way?"
norway_mod.85.a:0 "Modern bokmål will do nicely. With the samnorsk initiatives, it's Norwegian enough"
norway_mod.85.b:0 "Nynorsk of course! Language based on how Norwegians speak, not how Danes write"

norway_mod.100.t:0 "The Moscow Trials"
norway_mod.100.d:0 "The Soviet Union has, and still is, going through some large and brutal internal changes. Many people of power and influence have been sentenced during the already infamous Moscow Trials.\n\nWith international press being allowed to attend, what has been noted is that surprising amounts of the people on trial have admitted to very serious crimes within the Union. Could they have been forced or pressured into admitting this? Is the General Secretary attempting to get rid of political opponents?\n\nAs news are brought back to Norway, media and people have speculated on what is going on, and often condemned the trials as unjust and suspect. Many of our political parties are now distancing themselves from the Comintern, and have moderated themselves. How shall we handle these reports from Moscow?"

##leader descriptions
POLITICS_JOHAN_NYGAARDSVOLD_DESC:0 "Born a farmer's son in Hommelvik, in what is now Malvik municipality, Johan Nygaardsvold had his first job at a sawmill at 12 years of age. He emigrated to Canada, and later the United States, as a young adult in 1902. There he took jobs in British Columbia, Montana and Washington.\n\nWhen he returned to Norway just five years later, he got into poltics to stay, and in 1910 he was elected to the board of education for the Labour Party, which he would continue to represent. Now he has already made his mark on Norwegian politics, being one of the people behind the so-called ''crisis accord'' with the Farmers' Party, which allowed him to form a Government in 1935, as was asked of him. His Government has been a large proponent of alleviating the effects of the Depression through progressive welfare policies, but maybe not so much of military spending and vigilant foreign policies."
POLITICS_NILS_TRAEDAL_DESC:0 "Born a farmer's son in Sunndal, Nils Trædal has had plenty of responsibility and political experience throughout his life. The jobs and leadership roles held in his adult life include working as; a priest, a politician, a former mayor, a former Church and Education minister of both Peder L. Kolstad's Government and Jens Hundeid's Government (1931-1932 and 1932-1933, respectively), an acting Prime Minister/Foreign Minister (early 1932), a Government representative of Møre og Romsdal county, and a former member of the Liberal Party.\n\nHe was also a co-founder of the Farmers' Party's predecessor, and he has now risen to become the party leader of the current Farmers' Party. An advocate for agricultural reform and a man of many talents, Norway can now enjoy the benefits of his varied experience."
POLITICS_IVAR_LYKKE_DESC:0 "Born in what was then called Trondhjem, Ivar Lykke was the son of a grocer and businessman. After he had worked in his father's business, his introduction to politics first came as he represented the trade industries in local politics. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1916, and was noted as a moderate and sober politician, representing the interests of practical businesses.\n\nHis acceptance of modern mixed economy, and his pleasant and humble demeanor, earned him much trust throughout the years. He turned down his first opportunity to become Prime Minister, but in 1926 his namesake Government formed, and this time with him as the Prime Minister of Norway. After this he has continued his work in politics, an example being the naming dispute of his home city, Trondhjem. The question was of whether it was to still be called Trondhjem or reverted to old Norwegian Nidaros. In March of 1931 it ended on Lykke's compromise suggestion, Trondheim."
POLITICS_VIDKUN_QUISLING_DESC:0 "A native of Fyresdal, young Vidkun Quisling was a talented student of humanities, history and natural sciences. In 1905 he enrolled in the Norwegian Military Academy, receiving the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants of that particular year. He did so well in his studies he earned an audience with the King, and he later went on to serve as an officer. During the Great War he detested the peace sentiment, but moderated his views after noting the enormous human costs of the war.\n\nSince then he served as an attaché, he served as the military's expert on Russian affairs, he helped Fridtjof Nansen organize humanitarian relief efforts following the Great War, he got married twice, he flirted with the Norwegian communist movement (no doubt inspired by the effective People's Militias of the Soviet Union), he served as the Defence Minister in Peder Kolstad's Agrarian Government (despite being neither an agrarian nor Kolstad's friend, but his experience and knowledge were undeniable), and finally he helped form the political party ''Nasjonal Samling'' out of the former political movement ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge''. Now he finally represents a party that follows his own political views, a distinct mix of nationalism and socialism."
POLITICS_ADAM_EGEDE_NISSEN_DESC:0 "Adam Hjalmar Egede-Nissen was born on a farm in Frol municipality. In his younger years he studied philosophy while working in the postal service, eventually becoming the head of the local distribution center of Vardø in 1897, near the Russian border. In 1900 his political career brought him into the Norwegian Parliament for the first time as a representative of the Liberal Party, Venstre. In 1905 he switched his political allegiance to the Labour Party, where he turned down another period in the Parliament in 1912 in favour of continued work for the Norwegian postal service.\n\nWhile holding experience both with regular jobs and politics, Egede-Nissen was no stranger to more radical approaches to getting things done either, having illegally smuggled and printed revolutionary literature, as well as formed a radical Miner's Union in 1906. His time in Vardø gave him insight into the growing revolutionary sentiment in Russia, which he's since supported to quite a large degree. He was the mayor of Stavanger from 1915 to 1919, during which he was fined for his involvement in the 1919 general strike in support of the Russian revolution. In 1918 he had also went to Russia and met with Lenin, while also attending a meeting dedicated to the formation of the now well known Comintern. When the Labour Party split in 1923, Egede-Nissen followed the more radical politicians and joined the Norwegian Communist Party, NKP."
