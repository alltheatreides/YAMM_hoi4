 JAP_light_cruiser_4:0 "Kai-Agano Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Kai-Agano Class were an improvement on the Agano class in virtually every way. Their increased armor and armament were designed to meet growing Japanese demand for a strong heavy-cruiser class."
 JAP_battleship_3:0 "Ise Class"
 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Ise class were constructed during WWI, but saw many improvements in the 1930s. Originally classified as dreadnought battleships, the improved Ise was upgraded with increased armor, main-armament and anti-aircraft that could fight off virtually any foe."
 JAP_battleship_4:0 "Izumo Class"
 JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "Taking from the design of the original Yamato class, the Izumo class concept moved the 3rd turret to the bow of the ship. Her heavy armor and front-facing armament insured a small profile when attacking. Her heavy secondary and anti-aircraft armament were huge improvements over previous Imperial Japanese battleships."
