leaderevent.1.t:0 "Stanley Baldwin Resigns" 


leaderevent.1.d:0 "Two weeks after the coronation of King George VI, Mr. Baldwin has announced that he will resign the premiership in order to retire at the age of 70. Having led the National Government on-and-off since 1923, he has been the steady hand responsible for bringing the British Empire out of the Great Depression, and in recent years has reluctantly overseen the beginning of Imperial re-armament and the abdication of King Edward VIII. He steps down as a popular and successful prime minister, but has he done enough to counter the growing threat from Germany?" 

leaderevent.1.a:0 "Mr. Chamberlain shall seek to form a government." 

leaderevent.2.t:0 "Édouard Daladier Resigns" 


leaderevent.2.d:0 "With the collapse of the Third Republic and the refusal of the German government to offer an Armistice, it must fall to fresh leadership to continue the fight from the colonies. Whilst few would doubt that Monsieur Daladier has been a fine prime minister, he simply could not contend with the extraordinary set of circumstances in which France has found herself. We can but pray there is light at the end of the tunnel."
 

leaderevent.2.a:0 "Monsieur Reynaud shall seek to form a government." 

leaderevent.3.t:0 "Marshal Pétain Resigns" 


leaderevent.3.d:0 "Marshal Pétain, the Lion of Verdun and Hero of France, is fast-approaching 90 years old. Though still strong, proud and of sound mind, the old Marshal cannot carry on forever, and the many burdens of state are slowly wearing him down. La Révolution Nationale must and shall continue, but it is now believed that the Prime Minister, François Darlan, would be better-placed to assume control of the French State."
 

leaderevent.3.a:0 "Admiral Darlan shall take over the reins of government." 

leaderevent.4.t:0 "The Fall of Mussolini" 


leaderevent.4.d:0 "For many years now King Victor Emmanuel III has watched his prime minister, the self-styled 'Duce' Benito Mussolini, with a mix of fear and confusion. Whilst the King was content to let the foolish clown prance around the world stage for as long as his antics brought Italy diplomatic and military prestige without the spilling of blood; now, however, the war effort is floundering and the Suez Canal remains in Allied control. Mussolini has been arrested, and the King has requested that a replacement be sent for, but which of the Marshals of Italy should he appoint?"
 

leaderevent.4.a:0 "Marshal Balbo shall form a government." 

leaderevent.4.b:0 "Marshal Badoglio shall form a government." 

leaderevent.4.c:0 "Marshal De Bono shall form a government." 

leaderevent.5.t:0 "The King Takes Control" 


leaderevent.5.d:0 "Despite the King's best efforts in recent years, Italy's war leadership under the Partito Nazionale Fascista has been catastrophic. It was hoped that by overthrowing the unpopular and incompetent 'Duce' that progress would be made, but [ITA.GetLeader]'s renewed defensive strategies have come to naught. The only option that remains is for the King to overthrow the useless Marshal and assume personal control of the government himself."
 

leaderevent.5.a:0 "The King shall assume command of government." 

leaderevent.6.t:0 "The Flight of Sir Oswald Mosley" 


leaderevent.6.d:0 "Though at first Sir Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists were seen as a welcome relief from the perceived widespread corruption and mismanagement associated with the National Government, it did not take long for Mosley's increasingly erratic behaviour to become a cause for concern. Of the numerous distinguished military figures who chose to keep a low profile during the present turmoil, the noted occultist, esoteric and armoured warfare proponent J.F.C. Fuller has for some time now been seen as a possible caretaker leader. A former ally of Mosley only recently promoted to Field Marshal by King Edward VIII, Fuller has at last chosen to step out of the shadows."
 

leaderevent.6.a:0 "Field Marshal Fuller shall assume command of government." 

leaderevent.7.t:0 "The 1939 General Election" 


leaderevent.7.d:0 "Due to the prolonged effects of the Great Depression and the deteriorating situation in Europe, there has not been a general election in Britain since 1935. Under the leadership of Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin and more recently [Root.GetLeader], the National Government has continued to steer the Empire through increasingly murky waters, and the Prime Minister now believes that a late autumn general election would help to steady the ship and provide the Conservative Party with a fresh mandate. It is thought that having helped the country avoid another Great War the government will 'romp home' to victory, but Mr. Attlee and the Labour Party are nonetheless feeling confident of making substantial gains."
 

leaderevent.7.a:0 "Conservative Party" 

leaderevent.7.b:0 "Labour Party" 

leaderevent.8.t:0 "The 1945 General Election" 

leaderevent.8.d:0 "Years of total war and strategic bombing have left the British Empire ravaged and shaken to its very core, but with the end now finally in sight a fresh general election has been called. [Root.GetLeader] is understandably confident of a renewed mandate for the Conservative Party, and much is being made of his status as the man who led Britain through the War. Despite these advantages, he has been privately informed that he is not seen as the man to 'win the peace' at home, and it seems many of the overseas votes have already been declared for Mr. Attlee's Labour Party..."
 

leaderevent.8.a:0 "Labour Party" 

leaderevent.8.b:0 "Conservative Party" 

leaderevent.9.t:0 "The 1945 General Election" 


leaderevent.9.d:0 "Years of total war and strategic bombing have left the British Empire ravaged and shaken to its very core, but with the end now finally in sight a fresh general election has been called. [Root.GetLeader] is understandably confident of a renewed mandate for the Labour Party, and much is being made of his status as the man who led Britain through the War. Though there is still a viable opposition in the form of Mr. Churchill's Conservative Party, they are not popular with the working classes or the many thousands of troops returning from overseas, and few see them as the right people to rebuild the country's infrastructure and public services."
 

leaderevent.9.a:0 "Labour Party" 

leaderevent.9.b:0 "Conservative Party" 

leaderevent.10.t:0 "Albert Sarraut Resigns" 


leaderevent.10.d:0 "With the situation in Spain having now deteriorated into full-scale civil war, there are many in government who fear the very real possibility of civil unrest in France; particularly from some of the more radical communist and anarchist elements within both the Army and the Chamber of Deputies. Despite these tensions, Monsieur Sarraut's administration has been attempting to provide Spain's Republican faction with machine guns and heavy artillery; a deeply unpopular policy and one likely to bring about a constitutional crisis. Rather than risk fresh elections or bring down the government, the Prime Minister has chosen to resign."
 

leaderevent.10.a:0 "Monsieur Daladier shall seek to form a government." 

leaderevent.11.t:0 "The Assassination of François Darlan" 


leaderevent.11.d:0 "Never the most popular of men, Admiral Darlan has today been slain by an assassin's bullet in his headquarters. The gunman has been named as Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a 20 year-old monarchist aligned with Henri d'Orléans, the supposed comte de Paris. His precise motives are unclear and indeed irrelevant; he is a traitor and will be executed by firing squad. Despite the Admiral's death the business of government must continue, and therefore the Prime Minister now also assumes the role of Chief of the French State."
 

leaderevent.11.a:0 "Monsieur Laval shall take over the reins of government." 

leaderevent.12.t:0 "Darlan Survives Assassination Attempt" 


leaderevent.12.d:0 "Never the most popular of men, Admiral Darlan today narrowly escaped an assassin's bullet in his headquarters. The gunman has been named as Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a 20 year-old monarchist aligned with Henri d'Orléans, the supposed comte de Paris. His precise motives are unclear and indeed irrelevant; he is a traitor and will be executed by firing squad. In light of the assassination attempt, the Prime Minister has stressed the need for a review of Admiral Darlan's security detail and a full investigation into how this near-tragedy was allowed to happen."
 

leaderevent.12.a:0 "We must redouble our efforts." 

leaderevent.13.t:0 "Military Coup Against Nazi Regime" 


leaderevent.13.d:0 "With the Rhineland once again under foreign occupation and enemy troops pushing into Germany itself, the Third Reich's foreign policy lays in tatters; without herculean effort the war is surely lost. Senior elements within the Wehrmacht have for several years now consistently argued against Nazi diktat, warning that the rearmament process was nowhere near complete. In the so-called Kaiser-Putsch, the 'Führer' and his thuggish Nazi sycophants have been overthrown by a small but influential monarchist wing of the Heer operating under instruction from Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen, the legendary 'Amerikanerfresser'."
 

leaderevent.13.a:0 "The old order has been restored." 

leaderevent.14.t:0 "Adolf Hitler Commits Suicide" 


leaderevent.14.d:0 "With the armies of the Third Reich being defeated on all fronts, the situation looks increasingly dire. The collapse of our German border defenses mean that the enemy now approaches Festung Berlin itself; the Führer has reluctantly conceded that the War is lost, and very likely Germany along with it. He and his new wife, Eva Braun, have today in the Führerbunker taken their own lives with the help of cyanide capsules and a gunshot wound to the head. As per the Führer's last will and testament, Großadmiral Karl Dönitz is to succeed him as head of state and leader of the war effort. The world watches..."
 

leaderevent.14.a:0 "Heil Dönitz!" 

leaderevent.15.t:0 "China and the Axis" 

leaderevent.15.d:0 "Our recent support for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang regime has not been without controversy, and especially from those both in government and the Wehrmacht who have long-argued for an alliance with the Empire of Japan. However, the ongoing situation in the Far East means that now is as good a time as any to approach the Chinese leadership with a formal offer of alliance. Should we invite Nanjing to the Axis?"
 

leaderevent.15.a:0 "Yes, we must subdue Asia." 

leaderevent.15.b:0 "No, they are irrelevant." 

leaderevent.16.t:0 "Invitation to the Axis" 

leaderevent.16.d:0 "For many years now the German Wehrmacht has been involved in training and arming the National Revolutionary Army, and thanks to the advanced German officer corps we have slowly brought our armies up to European standards. Today, a cable came in from Berlin asking whether the great Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek would consent to signing the Tripartite Pact, alongside representatives from the Third Reich and the Kingdom of Italy. We have been invited to the powerful Berlin-Rome Axis; should we become the third member?"
 

leaderevent.16.a:0 "Yes, they will make powerful allies." 

leaderevent.16.b:0 "No, they are cruel and barbarous fanatics." 

leaderevent.17.t:0 "China Accepts Axis Membership" 

leaderevent.17.d:0 "Wisely, [CHI.GetNameDef] has accepted our offer of a formal alliance. They are now a member of the Axis powers and our bastion in the East."
 

leaderevent.17.a:0 "Excellent!" 

leaderevent.18.t:0 "China Rejects Axis Membership" 

leaderevent.18.d:0 "For reasons quite unfathomable, the Chinese leadership have rejected our offer to join the Axis. They disapprove of our 'methods' and question our motives. In hindsight, the generals were probably right... we should have gone with Japan. For this slight, China must be wiped from the face of the Earth."
 

leaderevent.18.a:0 "We will crush them!" 

leaderevent.19.t:0 "Germany Demands Alsace-Lorraine" 

leaderevent.19.d:0 "For some time now the Nazi regime in Berlin has been posturing and sabre-rattling, attempting to intimidate its smaller neighbours and subsume various German-speaking peoples into the Reich. We have tried to understand the Führer's concerns and we have listened to his grievances, but clearly Austria was not enough and his word means nothing. Now the Führer claims Alsace-Lorraine, so what are we to do? France does not want another war and may not even survive one, but surely we cannot acquiesce to these Nazi thugs?"
 

leaderevent.19.a:0 "Regrettably, we must surrender Alsace-Lorraine." 

leaderevent.19.b:0 "Enough is enough!" 

leaderevent.20.t:0 "France Accepts German Claims" 

leaderevent.20.d:0 "The cowardly French have finally accepted our rightful claim to Elsass-Lothringen and surrendered it to the Reich. Even now, Wehrmacht garrison troops are marching into Strassburg and Metz. The lies of Versailles have been reversed."
 

leaderevent.20.a:0 "At last, 1918 is avenged!" 

leaderevent.21.t:0 "France Rejects German Claims" 

leaderevent.21.d:0 "The cowardly French have refused to accept our rightful claim on Elsass-Lothringen and continue to hide behind their 'invincible' Maginot Line. The French foreign minister has rebuffed our political efforts, and all German diplomatic personnel are now being expelled from France."
 

leaderevent.21.a:0 "They will pay the iron price." 

leaderevent.22.t:0 "Destruction of the Maginot Line" 

leaderevent.22.d:0 "The final victory over [FRA.GetNameDef] has seen the rightful transfer of Elsass-Lothringen back to [GER.GetNameDef] after its unlawful theft in 1918. We can now pull down the Maginot Line, that symbol of French cowardice and false defiance."
 

leaderevent.22.a:0 "Mr. Todt, tear down this wall!" 

leaderevent.23.t:0 "Destruction of Fort Eben-Emael" 

leaderevent.23.d:0 "Our crushing victory over [BEL.GetNameDef] has seen the annexation of the Wallonische Region into [GER.GetNameDef]. The famous Fort Eben-Emael, part of the so-called Fortified Position of Liège, can now be pulled down."
 

leaderevent.23.a:0 "Better than it being used against us later." 

leaderevent.24.t:0 "Destruction of the Alpine Line" 

leaderevent.24.d:0 "With the fall of [FRA.GetNameDef] and our acquisition of Savoia, we can begin work pulling down the Alpine Line, the southernmost section of the once-formidable Maginot Line."
 

leaderevent.24.a:0 "Knock it down!" 

leaderevent.25.t:0 "The Hatay Question" 

leaderevent.25.d:0 "The region currently known as Hatay Province has been administered as part of the French Mandate of Syria since 1925, but prior to that was part of the Aleppo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. A region of great cultural and religious diversity, Hatay is politically divided between Syrian nationalists, Turkish secessionists, and French colonialists. Now, following June's rigged referendum, the Kemalist leadership in Ankara are demanding we return the province to [TUR.GetNameDef]. There are other options, but what should we do?"
 

leaderevent.25.a:0 "Return Hatay." 

leaderevent.25.b:0 "Keep Hatay." 

leaderevent.25.c:0 "Grant Syria independence." 

leaderevent.26.t:0 "France Returns Hatay Province" 

leaderevent.26.d:0 "Following June's free and fair elections in Hatay Province in which an overwhelming majority voted to rejoin [TUR.GetNameDef], the government of [FRA.GetNameDef] has finally acquiesced to the will of the people. After twenty years of foreign colonial rule, Hatay is ours once again."
 

leaderevent.26.a:0 "Then they shall be our friends." 

leaderevent.27.t:0 "France Keeps Hatay Province" 

leaderevent.27.d:0 "Following June's free and fair elections in Hatay Province in which an overwhelming majority voted to rejoin [TUR.GetNameDef], the government of [FRA.GetNameDef] has firmly rejected the will of the people. Despite twenty years of foreign colonial rule, the good people of Hatay must endure further suffering. If we wish to retake Hatay, it looks like we must do so by force."
 

leaderevent.27.a:0 "Germany may offer an alternative..." 

leaderevent.28.t:0 "France Affirms Syrian Independence" 

leaderevent.28.d:0 "Following June's free and fair elections in Hatay Province in which an overwhelming majority voted to rejoin [TUR.GetNameDef], the government of [FRA.GetNameDef] has chosen not only to defy our humble request for the return of Hatay Province, but has gone so far as to release [SYR.GetNameDef] as an independent state. This is a truly astonishing turn of events, and we should not rule out the use of force to redress the situation."
 

leaderevent.28.a:0 "Liberation must be an option." 

leaderevent.29.t:0 "The Future of Manchukuo" 

leaderevent.29.d:0 "We have effectively been a puppet state of [JAP.GetNameDef] since 1932, but the deteriorating situation in China means that many of our politicians are now clamouring for independence. Though lacking in industry, [MAN.GetNameDef] is vast and has great potential. What should we do?"
 

leaderevent.29.a:0 "Let us go it alone." 

leaderevent.29.b:0 "Maintain Japanese protection." 

leaderevent.30.t:0 "Indian Independence Promised" 

leaderevent.30.d:0 "For some years now the traditionally efficient Imperial bureaucracy has been undermined and sabotaged by the non-violent protest movement led by Mr. Gandhi and his cohorts. As Mr. Churchill put it in 1931, "it is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor." Thankfully, the promise of Indian independence after the War's conclusion has led Mr. Gandhi's followers to cease their protests -- much to the benefit of [RAJ.GetNameDef]."

leaderevent.31.a:0 "Extra troops." 

leaderevent.32.t:0 "Further Maginot Line Demolition" 

leaderevent.32.d:0 "With the destruction of the primary redoubts in Alsace-Lorraine, we should consider removing the remnants of the former Maginot Line along the Franco-Belgian border. It was often proposed that a line of forts should be extended to the English Channel, and now with the Fall of France we have no need of these concrete eyesores."

leaderevent.34.t:0 "Intervention in the Spanish Civil War" 

leaderevent.34.d:0 "With Spain having finally descended into full-scale civil war, Europe's fragile network of alliances is now being tested to breaking point. Those nations, like [Root.GetName], which lie on the periphery of extremist political dogma must now make a choice: do we support the Nationalists or Republicans in Spain, or remain detached from such affairs?"
 

leaderevent.34.a:0 "Support the Nationalists." 

leaderevent.34.b:0 "Support the Republicans." 

leaderevent.34.c:0 "It is not for us to get involved." 

leaderevent.35.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sends Nationalist Volunteers" 

leaderevent.35.d:0 "Our loyal and courageous friends in [From.GetName] have sent us three additional Brigada Legionario, which now await our command in Coruña. Surely such evident international support for our regime heralds the end of the Republican cause?"
 

leaderevent.35.a:0 "Magnífico!" 

leaderevent.36.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sends Republican Volunteers" 

leaderevent.36.d:0 "Our loyal and courageous friends in [From.GetName] have sent us three additional Brigada Internacionales, which now await our command in Barcelona. Surely such evident international support for our regime heralds the end of the Nationalist cause?"
 

leaderevent.36.a:0 "Magnífico!" 

leaderevent.37.t:0 "The Return of Chen Duxiu" 

leaderevent.37.d:0 "With the return to power of Leon Trotsky in [SOV.GetNameDef] and his call for world revolution, the isolationist, pro-Stalin regime under Chairman Mao has become increasingly untenable. In recent months it has become clear that Chen Duxiu, a co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party and long-time supporter of Trotsky, has won favor with the Politburo in Moscow. Now, after years of exile and disgrace, Chairman Duxiu has taken control of the government and seeks to form a Sino-Soviet Pact."
 

leaderevent.37.a:0 "Send word to Moscow at once." 

leaderevent.38.t:0 "Chen Duxiu Proposes Sino-Soviet Pact" 

leaderevent.38.d:0 "The fruits borne of our call for world revolution are many and varied. Even now, supporters of the Chinese exile Chen Duxiu have mounted a successful coup against the oppressive authoritarian regime of Mao Zedong, who is now feared dead. Chairman Duxiu's newly-appointed foreign minister has proposed that [PRC.GetNameDef] and [SOV.GetNameDef] sign a joint Sino-Soviet Pact and 'treaty of collectivist friendship in perpetuity.' Clearly our revolution has now spread to China, but should we take this step?"
 

leaderevent.38.a:0 "Very well, sign it." 

leaderevent.38.b:0 "Leave the Chinese to their fate." 

leaderevent.39.t:0 "Invitation to the Axis" 

leaderevent.39.d:0 "The German ambassador to [FIN.GetNameDef] has today presented the government with an invitation to become a member of the Axis powers and join the great crusade against Bolshevism. Finns have fought and died alongside Germans before, and it is not long ago that our brave soldiers were allied against the 'Red Menace' as it attempted to sweep across Europe. That said, should we get involved in this new and terrible Weltkrieg?"
 

leaderevent.39.a:0 "We have no choice, the Reds must be stopped!" 

leaderevent.39.b:0 "Our neutrality must be preserved." 

leaderevent.40.t:0 "Finland Accepts Axis Membership" 

leaderevent.40.d:0 "Wisely, [FIN.GetNameDef] has accepted our offer of a formal alliance. They are now a member of the Axis powers and will join our crusade against the socialist virus."
 

leaderevent.40.a:0 "To Leningrad, then!" 

leaderevent.41.t:0 "Finland Rejects Axis Membership" 

leaderevent.41.d:0 "Wishing to preserve his country's neutrality and independence, the ever-craven Finnish ambassador has rejected our benevolent offer of military alliance. Reasons were given, although apparently Herr Ribbentrop was so incensed at the reply that he neglected to take note of them. It is a black day for German diplomacy."
 

leaderevent.41.a:0 "No matter, they shall be next to fall." 

leaderevent.42.t:0 "Japanese Defeat in China" 

leaderevent.42.d:0 "With our client states [MAN.GetNameDef] and [MEN.GetNameDef] defeated and the Emperor's forces being pushed back on all fronts, it is surely time to sue for peace with [CHI.GetNameDef]. Despite our best efforts, [JAP.GetNameDef] simply does not have the manpower or political will to continue a protracted land war in Asia.\n\nWe should cut our losses and make peace with the Chinese. Should we cede them our Chinese territories in exchange for an end to hostilities?"
 

leaderevent.42.a:0 "Yes, the game's up." 

leaderevent.42.b:0 "No, fight to the last man!" 

leaderevent.43.t:0 "The Treaty of Beijing" 

leaderevent.43.d:0 "Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang regime are now assured of their place in History! The vile Japanese have been pushed back to the sea and Manchuria is once again under Chinese rule.\n\nAn emissary for [JAP.GetNameDef] has sued for peace on the Emperor's behalf; he reports that the Japanese government is willing to cede the states of Taiwan, East Hebei and Kwantung in exchange for peace. In addition, [JAP.GetNameDef] will abandon its claims in Manchuria."
 

leaderevent.43.a:0 "The Middle Kingdom is victorious!" 

leaderevent.43.b:0 "Why should we stop now?" 

leaderevent.44.t:0 "The Treaty of Beijing Rejected" 

leaderevent.44.d:0 "The Chinese have rejected our overtures of peace; the Treaty of Beijing was torn up by Kuomintang officials during its first reading, and we now face the stark possibility of an endless war with [CHI.GetNameDef].\n\nIf we are to bring this war to a successful close [JAP.GetNameDef] will require new and deadly weapons."
 

leaderevent.44.a:0 "Are we safe on Fortress Japan?" 

leaderevent.45.t:0 "The Demilitarization of Korea" 

leaderevent.45.d:0 "One of the harshest terms of the Treaty of Beijing is the establishment of the Korean peninsula as an international demilitarized zone. At the insistance of the Kuomintang government, it is to come under the administration of the League of Nations. As such, all Japanese military personnel must now return to the Home Islands."

They were told [GER.GetNameDef] would be victorious, her honor and territory restored. 'The end will justify the means,' Dr. Goebbels shouted over the wireless. Clearly this has not happened, and there is now no end in sight. Hitlerism has failed. Strasserism must not."

From the ashes of the old Soviet state must come unity, harmony and rebirth. Viktor Baydalakov, a man of great courage and vision, speaks directly to the crowds with passion and sincerity.

Marshal Gamelin - the French commander-in-chief - claims this is necessary in order to defend both France and Belgium against future German aggression, although few in government believe that [GER.GetNameDef] wishes us any harm. Our policy of neutrality means we have no formal alliances, and surely [ENG.GetNameDef] will not risk yet another continental war by coming to our aid a second time.\n\nWe are between a rock and a hard place; what should we do?"
 

leaderevent.51.a:0 "Regrettably, we must acquiesce."

leaderevent.52.t:0 "Belgium Accepts" 

leaderevent.52.d:0 "[BEL.GetLeader] has sensibly accepted our generous offer of protection and placed the resources of the [BEL.GetAdjective] state at our disposal. With [BEL.GetAdjective] neutrality now at an end, Marshal Gamelin is free to move the French Army into Belgium to set up a flexible defensive line facing the Rhine, giving us a tremendous strategic advantage over [GER.GetNameDef].\n\nWe may have angered a few of our neighbors, but the added security and resources now afforded to us is surely a price worth paying."
 

leaderevent.52.a:0 "Magnifique!" 

leaderevent.53.t:0 "Belgium Rejects Ultimatum" 

leaderevent.53.d:0 "The stubborn and stupid government of [BEL.GetNameDef] has today signed their country's death warrant by refusing our generous offer of protection. By remaining outside [FRA.GetNameDef]'s sphere of influence, the Belgians serve only to weaken both us and themselves against the inevitable German onslaught.

Commanded by Renya Mutaguchi and Masakazu Kawabe, their twin aims are to reinforce and resupply Burma, and thence push westwards into Bengal. Obviously, this cannot be allowed to happen; whereas the mountains and jungles of Burma are easily defensible terrain, protecting the entire subcontinent is impossible.\n\nOur forces have already suffered serious losses in Burma, and the continued presence of the Indian National Army only worsens our situation as thousands of native troops continue to desert to the ranks of the Japanese 'liberators.'"
