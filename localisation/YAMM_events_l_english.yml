 yamm.1.t:0 "France in YAMM"
 yamm.1.desc:0 "France plays a bit differently in YAMM. \n Vichy will happen and you will lose all your troops. So you cannot expect to abandon France as your army will melt when you capitulate. \nSo give a jolly good fight to the jerries and enjoy the new Free France focuses (on the right of the focus tree) \nYou also get free divisions through events and focuses. \nYour role is key for Operation Torch in securing the beaches thanks to your Resistance Focuses. \n\nBonne chance et faites honneur à la République !"
 yamm.33.t:0 "The Valentine Tank"
 yamm.33.desc:0 "To develop its own tank forces, Canada has established tank production facilities but in terms of design it is much simpler to rely on the design from England. \n We have obtained the Valentine design patent and should be able to produce it in our own facilities now."
 yamm.33.a:0 "Thank you based UK."
 yamm.10.a:0 "Thanks for the heads up"
 yamm.30.t:0 "France stays neutral"
 yamm.30.desc:0 "The French Government at Vichy never joined the Axis but did not fight the English and the Allies either despite several attacks on its possessions. \n \n Not all French are happy with the situation but the official stance of the government in this world conflict is to maintain an armed neutrality and wait for the storm to pass out. \n \n France is defeated and must be rebuilt and it is not by joining a war again."
 yamm.31.t:0 "The Fight Goes On"
 yamm.31.desc:0 "The Battle for France is over, but the war still rages on. Do not leave juste because you lost metropolitan France. \n \n YAMM has some interesting mechanics for Free France in your National Focus (on the right) where you can help a lot for Operation Torch and get free divisions from the war in North Africa and later help in the war in Italy/D-Day. \n \n Courage !"
 yamm.34.t:0 "Hitler bursts into violent rage !"
 yamm.34.desc:0 "The failure to meet the objectives of the Caucasus and the military setbacks the operation created have pushed the Fuhrer to fits of incoherent rage that has been felt at all levels of the Army High Command as all fear for their position and who the Fuhrer is going to blame..."
 yamm.34.a:0 "Uh oh."
 yamm.35.t:0 "The Fate of the Danish Islands"
 yamm.35.desc:0 "The United Kingdom has suggested we occupy the Danish islands in the Arctic Circle to defend a possible German invasion."
 yamm.35.a:0 "We will do what we can"
 yamm.36.t:0 "Danish Islands Transfer Sovereignty"
 yamm.36.desc:0 "Diplomats from the United Kingdom and United States have announced that the Danish Islands in the Arctic Circle have been occupied. Questions were raised regarding the legality of this decision but both dignatories have insisted this was done to preempt a possible German Invasion."
 yamm.36.a:0 "Ok"
 enigma.1.t:0 "Marian Rejewski sends an Enigma Machine to the allies."
 enigma.1.d:0 "Marian Adam Rejewski was a Polish mathematician and cryptologist who in 1932 worked out how the plugboard-equipped Enigma machine, the main cipher device used by Germany, encoded messages.  The success of Rejewski and his colleagues Jerzy Rózycki and Henryk Zygalski jump-started British reading of Enigma messages in World War II.  The intelligence so gained, code-named Ultra, contributed, perhaps decisively, to the defeat of Nazi Germany.  Five weeks before the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Rejewski and his colleagues presented their results on Enigma decryption to French and British intelligence representatives. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Polish cryptologists were evacuated to France, where they continued their work in collaboration with the British and French."
 enigma.1.a:0 "Give them Enigma"
 enigma.1.b:0 "No!"

 enigma.2.a:0 "Excellent!  Let's crack the code."
 enigma.3.t:0 "Operation ULTRA"
 enigma.3.d:0 "ULTRA was the name used by the British for intelligence resulting from decryption of encrypted German radio communications in World War II. The term eventually became the standard designation for all intelligence from high-level cryptanalytic sources.  The name arose because the code-breaking was considered more important than the highest security classification available at the time, (Most Secret), and so was regarded as being Ultra secret.  Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, hence the term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts".  The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is credited with having provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and with having shortened the war, though Ultra's precise influence is still being studied and debated.  We will gain a decrypt against Germany."
 enigma.3.a:0 "Bletchley Park is our Intel center now."
 enigma.3.b:0 "No"
 enigma.4.t:0 "Requisition of Bletchley Park"
 enigma.4.d:0 "Military Intelligence section 6 (MI6) the UK's foreign intelligence agency, weeks before the outbreak of World War II, in Warsaw, Poland's Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau) revealed its achievements in decrypting German Enigma ciphers to French and British intelligence.  The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.  The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages. These proved too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections."
 enigma.4.a:0 "That should do it."
 enigma.5.t:0 "Continue to improve Bletchley Park."
 enigma.5.d:0 "Listening stations  the Y-stations (such as the ones at Chicksands in Bedfordshire and Beaumanor Hall in Leicestershire, the War Office 'Y' Group HQ)  gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley.  Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle couriers or, later, by teleprinter. Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German Enigma machine, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German Fish High Command teleprinter cyphers.  The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named "Ultra".  It contributed greatly to the Allied success in defeating the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, and to the British naval victories of the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Battle of North Cape."
 enigma.5.a:0 "Okay"
 enigma.6.t:0 "Bletchley Park is now fully operational."

 enigma.10.t:0 "Enigma M4"
 enigma.10.d:0 "A four-rotor Enigma machine was introduced by the Navy for U-boat traffic on 1 February 1942, called M4 (the network was known as Triton, or "Shark" to the Allies).  The extra rotor was fitted in the same space by splitting the reflector into a combination of a thin reflector and a thin fourth rotor. This resulted in a greater encrypt capability - now and for some months, the Allies will not be able to intercept our convoy raids."

This resulted by a great encrypt capability and since, our Navy is not able to intercept the German convoy raids.  Our generals ask us to urgently research a way to crack the Enigma codes if we want to protect our convoys.\n\nIf you accept, we will invest 5% of our manpower until the code is cracked."
